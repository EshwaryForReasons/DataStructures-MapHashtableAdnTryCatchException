Sequential search vs binary search
10/08/2023 21:08:00
Sequential search works by comparing each element in the array to the target value, starting at the beginning of the array.\
Binary search works by dividing the array in half and then searching the half that is more likely to contain the target value.

I think efficiency algorithms make sorting algorithms more useful than anthers.
10/11/2023 09:05:00
In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.\
The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

Question ???
10/11/2023 09:08:00
What are the top 3 most important sorting algorithms in our topics? 
Leota M. Dilliard
Regarding selection sort
10/11/2023 23:20:00
Selection sort helpful because it helps us in searching for the smallest element in the unsorted sublist.
Sage Wieser
Is selection sort better han quick sort?
10/11/2023 16:53:00
Is there a particular instance where a simpler sorting algorithm is better than a sorting algorithm like quick sort?

Efficiency
10/11/2023 18:31:00
Some sorting algorithms have better time and/or memory efficiency than others.\
It really depends on the applications and what the program is trying to accomplish.

Merge sort
10/11/2023 19:01:00
Merge sort helps to merge two arrays together.
James D. Pham
Also merge sort
10/11/2023 21:05:00
Merge sort allows to programmer to sort the data structure in half, from this it then merges the sorted sub arrays into one.

Bubble Sort

Slowest sorting algorithm that works by comparing each pair of elements in the given order.

Performance of algorithms
10/11/2023 21:40:00
Performance of an algorithm means predicting the resources which are required to an algorithm to perform its task.\
That means when we have multiple algorithms to solve a problem, we need to select a suitable algorithm to solve that problem.

Selection sort
10/11/2023 22:31:00
This is important to know because it works well with smaller lists and has good memory usage

Bubble Sort
10/11/2023 23:14:00
A sort that forwards smaller values compared to the data next to it.

Linear search
10/11/2023 23:15:00
Searching is a common task and linear search is one way to search, linear search means to look for an element in an array or list and inspeacting it. 
Rozella Ostrosky
Selection Sort
10/11/2023 23:22:00
Finds the smallest value in a list and brings it to the front
Valentine L. Gillian
Quick sort
10/11/2023 23:30:00
Quick sort is useful for sorting array. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot
Kati Rulapaugh
Insertion sort
10/11/2023 23:32:00
It can help with already sorted lists
Dyan Oldroyd
Linear Searching
10/11/2023 23:51:00
Will check every element in a list but is very slow
Roxane Campain
Selection sort
10/11/2023 23:52:00
Selection sort useful for locating the smallest element in the unsorted sublist.
Lavera Perin
Binary search
10/12/2023 23:20:00
Binary search divides the search space in half each time. asks higher or lower question
Erick B. Ferencz
Big O notation
10/12/2023 20:45:00
Big O notation gives metric to identify efficiency
Hopkins Hennepin
Merge sort
10/13/2023 15:35:00
Merge sort divides arrays and merges / combines them
